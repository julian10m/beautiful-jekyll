## Verifiable Data Plane

I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Networks as a student of the University of Strasbourg, at the ICube Laboratory in France.
The topic of my Ph.D. is “Verifiable Data Plane” and I am working under the supervision of [Prof. Cristel Pelsser](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=es&user=H8FD7qQAAAAJ) and [Pascal Mérindol](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RioxMC8AAAAJ&hl=es&oi=ao).

The objective of the Ph.D. is to study new alternatives to cope with routing insecurity on the Internet. 
In a nutshell, the goal is to propose architectures, algorithms and protocols that provide shield to the communications on the Internet, particularly at the data-plane.
This new solution should be able to detect and possibly prevent attacks, such as:
  
 * deviation of packets from the path that has been advertised in the control-plane,
 * middlebox manipulation and tampering and, 
 * deliberate QoS degradation.
 
This way, Internet users will find means to verify that their information on the Internet is kept safe.
In particular, the proposed solutions should be undetectable by malicious devices, meaning that adversaries should not be able to tell that their behaviour is being analyzed (viaspecific tools recognizable from the data in production).
In addition, the security method to be developed needs to be lightweight so as to avoid introducing latency and overhead that could compromise the network performance.

## Toward Reliable and Deterministic Networks in Industrial-IoT applications
 
 Concerning my previous work, I made an internship on the field of Industrial Wireless Networks, on the topic ``Toward Reliable and Deterministic Networks in Industrial-IoT applications". The purpose of the internship was to obtain a network with a highly-reduced packet loss and a constant delay (no jitter). These type of networks are said to be deterministic, and envisioned to put up to the requirements of the Industry 4.0. We implemented a cross-layer protocol that improved on the performance of the currently used in 6TiSCH networks (RPL+TSCH). Our research lead to two papers being published:

* [_"From Best Effort to Deterministic Packet Delivery for Wireless Industrial IoT Networks"_](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8412519)
 * In IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics 2018 (Impact Factor: 6.764),
* [_"Toward Deterministic Industrial Networks"_](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01519185/document)
 * In AlgoTel-CoRes 2017 (French speaking conference where I presented the work).
