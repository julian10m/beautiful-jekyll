## Verifiable Data Plane

I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Networks as a student of the University of Strasbourg, at the ICube Laboratory in France.
The topic of my Ph.D. is “Verifiable Data Plane” and I am working under the supervision of [Cristel Pelsser](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=es&user=H8FD7qQAAAAJ) and [Pascal Mérindol](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RioxMC8AAAAJ&hl=es&oi=ao).

  * In Network Traffic Measurement and Analysis Conference (TMA) 2019.

## Toward Reliable and Deterministic Networks in Industrial-IoT applications
 
 Concerning my previous work, I made an internship on the field of Industrial Wireless Networks, on the topic "Toward Reliable and Deterministic Networks in Industrial-IoT applications".
